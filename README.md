<p>Github catds is a way for you to access your github profile account from any device, built specifically for mobile it still works well on other screens.  First things first is to begin your search (this can be for yourself or someone else you might know or follow). </p>

<p>After your fire off your search you will have some of the most useful information at your fingertips you can track your public repos and gists. You can also keep track of how many people your following and how many are following you as well. The idea behind this was to give user quick access to creating a gist of a piece of code or a note from a stackoverflow blog they you were reading on your phone. Also for developers of open source code help you manage the bugs and track issues with your code pase right from your phone(these two features will be implemented soon).For now you have a nice way to look at other devs github profiles while on your phone.</p>
